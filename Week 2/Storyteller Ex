This is a real job interview question from a data analysis company, and I doubt there is a
standard answer to this question. So feel free to explore your story by using the data exploration
and transformation techniques appropriately.

Here is a small dataset for you to work with.
Each of 5 schools (A, B, C, D and E) is implementing the same math course this semester, with
35 lessons. There are 30 sections total. The semester is about 3/4 of the way through.
For each section, we record the number of students who are:
• very ahead (more than 5 lessons ahead)
• middling (5 lessons ahead to 0 lessons ahead)
• behind (1 to 5 lessons behind)
• more behind (6 to 10 lessons behind)
• very behind (more than 10 lessons behind)
• completed (finished with the course)
What’s the story (or stories) in this data? Find it, and tell it visually and, above all, truthfully.
