# Initial Observations and Remarks

#Observe:

# - Schools B and D do not follow the same picture that was shown by the data combined. 
# - A, C, and E follow generally the same pattern as shown by figure 1
# - B shows many students ahead of the curriculum, completing the program. 
 #- The majority of students that are behind are behind by 1-5 assignments and very few are in the lowest two categories. 
 #- This is the most positive picture that the data shows out of the schools.
 #- School D is the opposite with a small percentage of students having completed all assignments and a large percentage of students being considered 'Very Behind'. 

```

```{r}
#Comparing the two schools as a representation of the population of program takers ... 

sum(StudentSumsB)/sum(StudentSums)

sum(StudentSumsD)/sum(StudentSums)
```

```{r}
#School D has a small number of students, meaning that the data from school D has a greater probability of not being representative of the situation and may be acconted for by random chance. School B is a sample that is approximately one quarter of the overall population, making it more representative of the situation. It also shows that school B is doing something that the rest of the schools are not in order to get students through the course.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
